	// - If TrackId is specified: The track to enforce. Automatically sets 1 to ServerControlsTrack
	// - If VehicleModelId is specified: The vehicle to enforce. Automatically sets 1 to ServerControlsVehicle, sets FORCE_IDENTICAL_VEHICLES to Flags
	// - If VehicleClassId is specified: The class to enforce. Automatically sets 1 to ServerControlsVehicleClass, sets FORCE_SAME_VEHICLE_CLASS to Flags
	// - Track, vehicle model, vehicle class and all enum/flags attributes can use values in string forms - so you can use either track id, or track name.
	// - Flags in string form can contain multiple flags separated by comma, so for example "ABS_ALLOWED,SC_ALLOWED,TCS_ALLOWED"
	// - The setup should never contain any of the "ServerControls" attributes, those are decided automatically.
	// - The setup should never contain both VehicleModelId and VehicleClassId at the same time. Restrict either the class or specific vehicle.
	// - The Flags attribute should never contain FORCE_IDENTICAL_VEHICLES or FORCE_SAME_VEHICLE_CLASS flags, those are decided automatically.

	// The rotation. Array of setups to rotate. If empty, just the default setup will be used with no actual rotation happening.
	//
	// These setups are applied on top of the default setup, then applied to the game. Previous setup in the rotation is never used.
	// So for example if you wanted to repeat the same track in multiple consecutive setups, different from the default track,
	// each of those setups needs to explicitly include that track. Also remember that apart from the flags nothing can be "removed"
	// from the default setup, so if the default setup contains a track, some track will always be enforced (either the default one,
	// or the setup-specific one). And one last thing, these override setups can never include an attribute that's not specified in
	// the default setup - it can just override some of the default attributes, not add new ones. The only exception are the
	// track/vehicle/class attributes.
	//
	// Attributes in these setups can have a special attribute RemoveFlags set, which will remove the specified flags from the default
	// setup instead of adding them to it (which is what the Flags attribute will do)
